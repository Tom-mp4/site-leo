                <p class="description">
                    I am Leo Lavender, a 18 years old cgi artist, and I’ve decided to drop school to learn 3D and graphism by myself. My works are often surrounded by a dark and heavy atmosphere, creating a deep essence, in order to make a source of inspiration for many people. I spend every days learning new techniques and methods to improve my workflow but also a lot of things about the world, the diferents cultures, civilizations, in order to make my creation style more interesting.
                    <br><br><br>“If you want to become a great artist, as I do, don’t forget to work on your own self development, beside learning your art techniques. Learn how to not be dependent of anyone, to not compare your work to other artists, and realize the key is to create your own, your unique way to go through your artist journey. Your path might not look like your favorite artist one, but it doesn’t matter. Focus on it every days because this is what they did too when they started.” -Leo

                    WHAT DO I DO ?
                </h2>
                <p class="description">
                    I mainly focus on 3D creations, using the software Blender and the render engine Octane, which I just started to use. I can create animations to make loops, visualizer, or short video shots.
                    I can edit your photos and videos to create differents kind of aesthetic, I use After effects and Photoshop.
                    You can find a lot of examples of my global skills on the gallery section.

                    Remember that I am not an art director, I didn’t made any studies for this, when you contact me to work on your ideas, please keep that in mind.
